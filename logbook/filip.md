Docker, a tool most developers use. Which I have never used. So this was a first for me. And let me tell you, It was **NOT** a good experience. First of all. The CLI, I like many people don't like GUIs. They abstract a lot of the things away from the user. So I prefer using the CLI. This was not the greatest choice since almost every ███████ user uses the Docker desktop application. Anyway so I watched a bunch of tutorials and learned some basic commands like `docker build` and `docker run`. I also learnt about tagging. In the end I built a two step docker file. The first "compiles" the code. I use the term compiler loosly since it technically is an installer but I digress. The second step runs the code and that's about it. It was definetly an interesting day to say the least.

Note: I wanna use NIX

Sooooo... Docker..... Yeahhh.... I don't really want to work with it but oh well. I managed to set up a dev container today with vscode. It was easier than I thought. I also set up a basic flask server just to see if the port forwarding and python installation worked and suprisingly both worked. Hurray! I also switched from using the normal python docker file from docker hub to the `-alpine` version. This trimmed down the file size by almost a 100Mb which is nice.
