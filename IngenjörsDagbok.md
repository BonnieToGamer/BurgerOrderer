Today I have started with the API for the BurgerOrderer project. First of all i cloned the project-repository and made my own branch. Thereafter I got Filip's help to install and learn how Postman works. After playing around with Postman I started working on the menu and coming up with names for burgers and what specials you could ass/remove.
