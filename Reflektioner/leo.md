Today I have started with the API for the BurgerOrderer project. First of all i cloned the project-repository and made my own branch. Thereafter I got Filip's help to install and learn how Postman works. After playing around with Postman I started working on the menu and coming up with names for burgers and what specials you could add/remove. I wrote these in a json file.

Today I finished writing the different burgers and specials in the json file. Along the way I used Postman to test that you could retrieve the list from the json file.
