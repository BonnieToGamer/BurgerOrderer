## Short summary of what's been done
The project is split into two Containers. But in total uses 4 for full functionality. It has the two containers for KitchenView and BurgerOrderer and the other two are for MongoDB and mongo-express. 

## Experience in implementing
The implementation went smoothly almost no hiccups except for the websocket's not functioning. We simply had to replace the websocket's with a simple print out to std output. We also had some issues when merging. Since we started all implementing on different branches it caused some chaos trying to merge it all. In the end Filip merged manually by copy pasting files. Which is not how it should be done. We also looked through each others code throughout the process in order to help when the others got stuck.

## Working with containers
Working with containers was good overall. It had it's ups and downs but in the end it worked out quite nicely. Although learning about containers and docker turned out to be quite a challenge. Since it brought on a whole new level of complexity where you weren't certain which files where copied over and which weren't. Some challenges during implementation were that VSCodes dev containers didn't work with monorepos like this one. So it had to manually be changed to work in a different project.
